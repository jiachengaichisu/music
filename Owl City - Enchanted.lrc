[00:00.00]Enchanted - Owl City (Ã¨Í·Ó¥Ö®³Ç)
[00:12.64]There I was again tonight forcing laughter faking smiles
[00:17.66]Same old tired lonely place
[00:20.80]
[00:22.72]Walls of insincerity
[00:25.22]Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
[00:30.18]
[00:30.77]All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
[00:40.26]
[00:42.94]Your eyes whispered have we met
[00:45.41]Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
[00:51.39]
[00:53.19]The playful conversation starts
[00:55.49]Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
[01:01.21]All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
[01:10.03]
[01:11.17]Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too
[01:22.84]
[01:24.28]This night is sparkling don't you let it go
[01:29.20]I'm wonderstruck blushing all the way home
[01:34.06]I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
[01:38.88]I was enchanted to meet you too
[01:43.90]
[01:49.07]The lingering question kept me up
[01:51.23]2AM who do you love
[01:53.65]I wondered till I'm wide awake
[01:56.52]
[01:58.95]Now I'm pacing back and forth wishing you were at my door
[02:03.46]I'd open up and you would say
[02:06.69]
[02:07.48]Hey it was enchanting to meet you
[02:15.98]
[02:17.03]Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too
[02:28.61]
[02:29.98]This night is sparkling don't you let it go
[02:34.75]I'm wonderstruck blushing all the way home
[02:39.67]I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
[02:44.92]I was enchanted to meet you too
[02:49.56]
[03:07.11]This is me praying that this was the very first page
[03:12.35]Not where the story line ends
[03:14.94]My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
[03:20.02]These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
[03:25.17]I was enchanted to meet you too
[03:30.34]Please don't be in love with someone else
[03:35.06]Please don't have somebody waiting on you
[03:39.20]
[03:39.90]Please don't be in love with someone else
[03:44.97]Please don't have somebody waiting on you
[03:49.38]
[03:50.76]This night is sparkling don't you let it go
[03:55.66]I'm wonderstruck blushing all the way home
[04:00.45]I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
[04:08.47]
[04:10.95]This night is flawless don't you let it go
[04:15.92]I'm wonderstruck dancing around all alone
[04:20.77]Taylor I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew
[04:25.96]I was enchanted to meet you too
[04:30.84]I was never in love with someone else
[04:35.55]I never had somebody waiting on me
[04:40.19]'Cause you were all of my dreams come true
[04:45.46]
[04:45.99]And I just wish you knew
[04:48.09]Taylor I was so in love with you
